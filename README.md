Project Description

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the closing price of NVIDIA stock. The workflow involves:

	•	Data collection from stock market APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance)
	•	Data preprocessing and feature extraction
	•	Model training using historical data
	•	Evaluation of models for prediction accuracy

The aim is to build a robust model that captures the trends in NVIDIA’s stock price and accurately predicts future prices.

Dataset

We use historical stock price data from sources like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage, including the following features:

	•	Date
	•	Open, High, Low, Close prices
	•	Volume traded
	•	Moving averages, Bollinger Bands, and other technical indicators

You can obtain the dataset from Yahoo Finance or use the yfinance Python library to fetch the data directly.
